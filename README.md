Warehouse Management System.

A full-featured web application with both frontend and backend components. The project includes database integration, a RESTful API, caching, pagination, validation, and user authentication via JWT tokens.

For the backend, I used Java with the Spring Boot and Hibernate frameworks, while the frontend was implemented using React and JavaScript. The application features a user-friendly interface that allows for seamless navigation and real-time inventory management directly on the site.

This project provided an opportunity to delve into creating secure and scalable web applications, focusing on high-level user and data management.
