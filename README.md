Warehouse management system, a full-featured web application with both frontend and backend components. The project includes database usage, RESTful API, Cache and user authentication via JWT Token. I implemented this project using Java along with the Spring Boot and Hibernate frameworks for the backend, and React, JS for the frontend. The application features a user-friendly interface that allows for easy navigation and real-time editing of inventory directly on the site. This project allowed me to delve into creating secure and scalable web applications, providing high-level user and data management.
